This project is made using material ui component library and json-server library to implement a basic mock server that does CRUD operations on employees information. All the data is stored in a static json file by the json-server. I am using axios for communication between server and the app in the browser.

There are some adjustments to the task requirements that I thought as a UX improvement. 
1. Add employee feature is implemented in a modal rather than a separate page.
2. To be continued... 

## To do list
1. Introduce input validation
2. Support integer column sorting
3. Improve chart color pallete
